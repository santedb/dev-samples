# SanteDB Jobs

SanteDB allows developers to write jobs which can be executed on a schedule or run ad-hoc by the end-user whenever they like. This project illustrates the implementation of IJob interfaces
and includes a sample daemon service which will register these jobs on startup of the daemon service.
